# Code Analysis: Plagiarism Detection with TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity

## Overview
The provided Python code aims to detect plagiarism among a set of text documents using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity. TF-IDF is a numerical statistic that reflects the importance of a word in a document relative to a corpus, while cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, typically in multi-dimensional space.

## Code Components

### Import Statements
- `os`: Imported to interact with the operating system, specifically to work with files and directories.
- `TfidfVectorizer` and `cosine_similarity` from `sklearn.feature_extraction.text` and `sklearn.metrics.pairwise` respectively, for implementing TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity calculation.

### Variables
- `student_files`: A list containing the filenames of student documents in the current directory with a `.txt` extension.
- `student_notes`: A list comprehension that reads each student document and stores its content in a list.

### Functions
- `vectorize`: Converts text data into TF-IDF vectors.
- `similarity`: Computes cosine similarity between two documents.

### Main Execution
1. **Vectorization**: Converts each student's notes into TF-IDF vectors.
2. **Plagiarism Check**: Compares each pair of documents using cosine similarity to detect plagiarism.
3. **Output**: Prints the detected plagiarism pairs along with their similarity scores.

## Code Execution Flow
1. **Vectorization**:
   - Each student's notes are vectorized using TF-IDF.
   - The resulting vectors are stored alongside the corresponding filenames.

2. **Plagiarism Check**:
   - For each student document (`student_a`), the code creates a copy of the list of document vectors.
   - For each other student document (`student_b`), the code computes the cosine similarity with `student_a`.
   - If similarity is detected, the pair of filenames and their similarity score are stored in `plagiarism_results`.

3. **Output**:
   - The detected plagiarism pairs along with their similarity scores are printed.

## Conclusion
- The code successfully implements a basic plagiarism detection mechanism based on TF-IDF and cosine similarity.
- However, there are some potential areas for improvement, such as:
  - Lack of preprocessing: The code does not include any text preprocessing steps like removing stopwords or stemming, which could improve the accuracy of plagiarism detection.
  - Efficiency: For larger datasets, the current approach may become inefficient due to the pairwise comparison of all documents.
  - Threshold setting: The code does not implement a threshold for defining plagiarism, which could be beneficial for tuning the sensitivity of the detection algorithm.
